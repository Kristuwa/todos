# About the application

This is an application for recording tasks that need to be done. You enter a task in the form and see it in the list below. When a task is completed, you mark its completion by clicking on the circle button on the left. At the bottom of the window, you can filter by type - All/Active/Completed . You can also clear the list of completed tasks.
